```

### Running the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Known Issues

1. Agent System:
   - Memory management needs optimization for long-running tasks
   - Task delegation sometimes fails with complex nested operations
   - Agent communication can be improved for better coordination

2. Integration Issues:
   - Rate limiting needs to be implemented for supplier APIs
   - Error handling for API timeouts needs improvement
   - Better retry mechanisms for failed API calls

3. Performance Issues:
   - Large product catalogs can cause slowdown
   - Real-time sync needs optimization
   - Memory leaks in long-running agent processes
