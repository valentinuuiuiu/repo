   - Add pagination for large data sets
   - Optimize component re-renders with proper dependency arrays

3. **Enhance Loading States**
   - Implement skeleton screens for better user experience
   - Add progressive loading for large components
   - Optimize initial load time with proper code splitting

## Security Enhancements

## AI Tools Implementation Recommendations

### Current AI Implementation Analysis

The project currently uses a DuckDuckGo search tool (`DDGSSearchTool`) for agents to search the web. This is a good starting point, but there are opportunities to enhance the AI capabilities:

1. **Search Tool Improvements**
   - Add error retry mechanisms for failed searches
   - Implement caching for search results to reduce API calls
   - Add more robust error handling and logging

2. **AI Agent Enhancements**
   - Implement more specialized AI tools for different agent types
   - Add natural language processing capabilities for better understanding of user queries
   - Create a feedback loop system for continuous improvement of AI responses

3. **Integration with LLM Providers**
   - The project already has dependencies for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google's Generative AI
   - Create a unified interface for interacting with different AI providers
   - Implement fallback mechanisms when one provider is unavailable

4. **AI-Powered Analytics**
   - Implement sentiment analysis for customer feedback
   - Add predictive analytics for inventory management
   - Create AI-driven recommendations for merchants

This comprehensive audit provides a roadmap for improving the DropConnect platform across multiple dimensions, ensuring better code quality, performance, security, and scalability while expanding the feature set to meet business needs.
